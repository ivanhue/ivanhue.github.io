                <h1>Hi, my name is Alejandro!</h1>
                <p>
                    I'm from Mexico City, Iztapalapa, and I studied Computer 
                    Science at Universidad Aut√≥noma Metropolitana. I've always
                    enjoyed learning about computers. I discovered programming 
                    when I tried to build my own video game. I loved that 
                    programming languages combine creativity with rules, giving 
                    structure and order, which I really enjoy.
                    <br><br>
                    During my studies, I got involved in several projects and 
                    student groups, volunteering to help new students and improve 
                    my community. I focused on Artificial Intelligence and got 
                    my first job in image detection at a small company. Later, 
                    a professor at my university offered me work on databases 
                    and a tool to help students improve their reading and writing 
                    skills.
                    <br><br>
                    Most recently, I worked as a full-stack developer using Django 
                    (MVT), creating forms, CRUDs, and maintaining APIs. These 
                    experiences helped me grow professionally, working on creative 
                    projects with limited resources, solving problems, and delivering 
                    solutions directly to users.

                <p>
                    I am results-focused and pay attention to detail. I have a proactive
                    attitude and enjoy solving problems. I maintain active communication 
                    and am always open to feedback, supporting diverse opinions. I like 
                    improving myself and collaborating to help my teammates grow. I can 
                    also take the lead or delegate responsibilities when needed. I'm a 
                    bit of a box of surprises, with many skills to bring to the team.
